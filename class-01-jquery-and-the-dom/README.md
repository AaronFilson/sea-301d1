# Assignment for Class 1 - jQuery and the DOM

## Welcome to your new blog!

- You will create a static blog site, to represent your personal online presence.
- You will be given a file [blog.js](blog.js) that has an array of blog posts ready to use.

## User Stories for Class 1
Let these user stories guide your development:
 - As a developer, I want my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.
 - As a reader, I want the blog to show most recent articles on top so that I can easily read the latest.
 - As a reader, I want relative timestamps to give me a idea of how many days ago something was written.

## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric

  - Use good Object Oriented code: Create a constructor function for articles.
  - Leave as little in the window (global) namespace as possible.
  - Create the markup for an example Article in the DOM, then clone that for each article.
  - Your Article prototype should have a `.toHtml()` function that adds new data to the DOM.
