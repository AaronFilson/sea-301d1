# Assignment for Class 11 - Routing and Web Requests

At the heart of every web app is the Web Request-Response Cycle. Pay close attention to how your app is creating and responding to requests.

The URLs that your app can respond to maps to your apps capabilities. Consider what public routes your app should have, and expose those as navigable URLs.

## User Stories
 1. As an reader, I want to link to each blog post, so that I can share individual articles.
 - As an author, I want my own author URL, so that I can easily highlight the articles I've written.
 - As a reader, I want to share articles by category, so that I can pass them on to others with my interests.
 - As a reader, I want the back button to track my actions, so that I can easily move between application states.

## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
 - Capture the URL for each request, and decide how to handle it.
 - Encapsulate each behavior within an appropriate level of abstraction.
 - Leverage the `history` API to let the user move between application states.
 - Group your controller code together in a single file.
