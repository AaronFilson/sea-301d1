# Assignment for Class 2 - jQuery and Events

Today we will work on a way to filter the view.  We will add the ability to select articles by category or author name.

We will use jQuery events to make this happen.

## User Stories for Class 2
  - As an author, I want my articles filtered by name so that readers can find all my posts.
  - As a reader, I want articles filterable by category so that I can read things that interest me.
  - As a reader, I want articles truncated to 50 words so that I can easily scroll though the whole list.
  - As a reader, I want the side nav to act as an accordion so that I can focus on one filter at a time.
  - As a reader, I want an About tab, so I can read the story of the site creator.
