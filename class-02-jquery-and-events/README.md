## User Stories for Class 2
 - As an author, I want my articles filtered by name so that readers can find all my posts.
 - As a reader, I want articles filterable by category so that I can read things that interest me.
 - As a reader, I want articles truncated to 50 words so that I can easily scroll though the whole list.
 - As a reader, I want the side nav to act as an accordion so that I can focus on one filter at a time.
 - As a reader, I want an About tab, so I can read the story of the site creator.
